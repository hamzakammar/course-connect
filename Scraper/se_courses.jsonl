To accommodate an elective reduced load, CHE102, CS343, CS348, CS349, CS449, ECE140, ECE192, ECE358, MSE343, and SE380 may be taken out of sequence. Courses in the Technical Electives Lists may not be taken before the 3A term. Students will only be permitted to use the WD and WF provisions used in the Faculty of Mathematics to withdraw from extra courses taken above the degree requirements. Exceptions to the requirements and electives listed above require prior approval of the Software Engineering Director. Specializations Students may choose to focus their elective choices by completing one (or more) of four available specializations. Specializations List SE-Artificial Intelligence Specialization, SE-Business Specialization, SE-Computational Fine Art Specialization, or SE-Human-Computer Interaction Specialization Notes Software Engineering students are considered as both Engineering and Mathematics students: Students can take advantage of degree enhancements available to students from either faculty. These enhancements take the form of additional plans such as options, specializations, minors, and joint honours. Before declaring any academic plan, see invalid credential combinations. Students are eligible for Awards of Excellence in the Faculty of Engineering as well as for Awards of Excellence in the Faculty of Mathematics. The Software Engineering plan is also considered an Honours Mathematics plan for purposes of student access to Mathematics courses.
